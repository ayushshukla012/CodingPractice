// Binary Search Tree implementation in Java
// A binary search tree (BST) is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. For each node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node's value, and all elements in the right subtree are greater than the node's value.
// This property makes binary search trees efficient for searching, inserting, and deleting elements.
//Example:
// 1. Create a binary search tree and insert elements into it.
// 2. Search for an element in the binary search tree.
// 3. Delete an element from the binary search tree.
// 4. Traverse the binary search tree in-order, pre-order, and post-order.
// 5. Find the minimum and maximum elements in the binary search tree.
// 6. Check if the binary search tree is balanced or not.
// 7. Find the height of the binary search tree.
// 8. Find the number of nodes in the binary search tree.
// 9. Find the level of a given node in the binary search tree.
